Weather App using OpenWeather API

[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org)

This is the first time I'm working with an API and JSON. Python makes it easy to pull the right information since JSON is basically a dictionary. All the features of this app can be found in the Open Weather documentation. At first it was difficult to understand but that was because I didn't know what JSON was...ðŸ˜²
